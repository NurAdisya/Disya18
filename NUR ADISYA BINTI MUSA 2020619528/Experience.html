Hi!!, I will tell you a little bit about my experience:).
<br><br><br> I am the youngest child in this family of three siblings.
When I was in primary school I started and was interested in selling. During school hours I sold kechain and sugar 
to my school friends. There was one day where I followed the Kokurikulum day sales program at school and made a lot 
of profit.When I was at school, the spirit of business was still in me where I sold my sister's hand made choco jars.
It got many requests at school but in the fifth grade I stopped selling because I was busy with my studies and helping
 my mother teach the children study the Quran.</p><center


<br><br><br>

<p>After finishing school, I followed a lot of catering because I was bored of staying at home for too long so I 
followed catering to get rid of the boredom besides earning money I can also meet many new friends. In addition, I also
 do a lot of business online by being an agent selling other people's products.
A little sweet experience that I want to share, which is last year when the pandemic hit, I was actively 
involved as a volunteer by following any government body that wanted to provide help such as face masks and necessities
 because at that time there were many people in need.</p><center>

<br><br><br>

<p>That all about <sub>my experience</sub>,thankyou.</p>
